                    <h1>HEY, I'M SANTOSH CHOUHAN</h1>
                    <p>Hello! I'm a student currently pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering at IIT Guwahati. While my academic focus is in Civil Engineering, my true passion lies in technology. I am particularly enthusiastic about full-stack development and competitive programming. I started coding in my first year of university and discovered web development during my sophomore year while participating in various events. Since then, I have been dedicated to honing my skills in creating seamless and innovative digital experiences and solving challenging problems.</p>
                    <p>Beyond technology, I have a variety of interests that keep me engaged and balanced. Iâ€™m passionate about fitness, biomechanics, and physiotherapy. To stay active and happy, I enjoy working out, propagating plants and trees, and spending quality time with friends.</p>
